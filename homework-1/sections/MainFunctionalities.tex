\section{Main Functionalities}
%What are the main functionalities of the web app? what services does it offer and how it is organized?
The web application is used to allow the administrator to interact with the database of WASCOOT, a web application regarding electric scooters to rent.
Furthermore, another important functionality of the web application  is to show the administrators some analytics regarding the rented scooters and customers, with the objective of giving some hints to improve the service. The website is divided into three main areas :
\begin{itemize}
    \item Dashboard area: here we have our analytics and the most useful information displayed, such as the scooter racks positions;
    \item Login area: here administrators can log in and access the web application services;
    \item Manage pages area: this is the core of the web application, here the administrators can interact with the database, we have one of this pages for every core table in the database (for example scooters' manage page) and from there the administrator can do a few operations :
    \begin{itemize}
        \item LIST, list all the rows of the table, e.g., list all the scooters in the database;
        \item CREATE, create a new instance/row of that entity, e.g., create a new scooter;
        \item EDIT, edit an existent row of the table, e.g., change something of a scooter.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
